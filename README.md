# ImgProcessingMIPS
This is a project from the course of Computer Organization and Architecture at Universidade de Bras√≠lia.
In this project we implement a few algorithms to perform visual effects on BMP image files, such as blur, boarder extraction and threshold. The purpose of this project is to introduce the low level processes that happen on a typical computer.
